# Half Heart Hardcore
Half Heart is a datapack designed to be played in hardcore mode with friends. After being enabled on a world, every player will have only half heart of max health. **Everyone's deaths effect each other, if anybody dies everyone dies, so be careful!**

This pack is great for a challenging experience with friends or a singleplayer gamemode. You don't necessarily have to play in hardcore, it just makes it so much worse when you die :)

Totems of undying work in a cursed way, thanks to the way I made this datapack. For instance, if there are two players, and one has a totem of undying, that will not save them from the consequences of their friend's death. If the player with the totem dies, their friend is then spared.

## WARNING
- Do not use the mod version in existing modpacks, it will apply to any world that is opened, and can technically be fixed, but only if you enable cheats.
